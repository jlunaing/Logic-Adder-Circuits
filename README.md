# Half and Full Adder Circuits
 Basics of digital design using half- and full-adder circuits in Verilog.

 ## Background
 Designing circuits that perform arithmetic operations is one of the most common
 first steps in digital design. The half adder, or HA, is a basic digital 
 circuits. The HA adds two bits and outputs the result of the addition (the sum) 
 and a bit that indicates whether the operation generated a carry out (CO).

 The half adder lacks the ability to handle a carry-in input. Thus, the next
 step is to byuld the full adder, or FA, is essentially a half adder with a 
 carry-in input. The outputs of FA are the same as the outputs of the HA.
